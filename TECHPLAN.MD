# Technical Plan – Matchify Swipe-to-Match Platform

## 1. Overview

Matchify is a **proof-of-concept mobile app and backend platform** for swiping and matching users with various types of content (recipes, travel destinations, workouts, movies, etc.). The platform is designed to be **flexible, extensible, and adaptable** to different target groups and content databases, supporting real-time matching and integration with external content providers.

## 2. System Architecture

```plaintext
[React Native Mobile App (Expo)]
         ↕ REST API + SignalR
    [ASP.NET Core Web API Server]
         ↕ MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL DB)
         ↕ External Content APIs (optional)
Frontend: React Native app built with Expo for cross-platform (iOS and Android).

Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API handles authentication, API endpoints, business logic, and real-time communication via SignalR.

Database: MongoDB Atlas stores users, content, swipes, and matches.

External APIs: Optional integration layer for fetching and normalizing third-party content data.

DevOps & Infrastructure: Docker containers for backend and database, CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, and infrastructure automation with Ansible for repeatable deployments.

3. Key Components
3.1 Frontend (React Native)
Swipe UI: Dynamic content cards for user swiping gestures.

Authentication: JWT-based login and registration flows.

Real-time updates: SignalR client for instant match notifications.

Content Views: Adaptable views for different content types.

Content Upload: Users can add new content with images.

## 3.2 Backend (ASP.NET Core API)
Authentication: JWT authentication with potential OAuth support.

Content Management: CRUD endpoints for content items.

Swipe Management: Record user swipe actions.

Match Engine: Detect mutual right-swipes to create matches.

SignalR Hub: Push real-time notifications to clients on matches.

External API Integration: Adapter layer to incorporate third-party content data.

## 3.3 Database (MongoDB)
Users: Profile and authentication data.

ContentItems: Flexible metadata-rich content entries.

Swipes: User swipe logs with direction and timestamp.

Matches: Records of matched users and content.

## 3.4 DevOps & Deployment
Containerization: Docker images for backend and services.

CI/CD: Automated pipelines for build, test, and deploy.

Infrastructure Automation: Ansible playbooks for server setup and app deployment.

Monitoring & Logging: Basic setups to ensure reliability and visibility.

## 4. Data Models (Simplified)
// User
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "username": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "passwordHash": "string",
  "profileImageUrl": "string",
  "preferences": { /* user preferences */ },
  "createdAt": "Date"
}

// ContentItem
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "type": "string", // e.g., recipe, travel, workout, movie
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "images": ["string"], // URLs
  "metadata": { /* flexible key-value pairs */ },
  "createdBy": "UserId",
  "createdAt": "Date"
}

// Swipe
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "userId": "UserId",
  "contentId": "ContentItemId",
  "direction": "left" | "right",
  "timestamp": "Date"
}

// Match
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "userIds": ["UserId", "UserId"],
  "contentId": "ContentItemId",
  "matchedAt": "Date"
}
## 5. API Endpoints (Examples)
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/auth/register	Register new user
POST	/api/auth/login	User login, returns JWT
GET	/api/content	Fetch swipeable content items
POST	/api/content/swipe	Submit swipe decision (left/right)
GET	/api/matches	Fetch user’s matches
POST	/api/content	Upload new content item

## 6. Real-time Communication
SignalR Hub: Server pushes notifications about new matches to clients in real time.

Client: React Native subscribes to SignalR hub and updates UI instantly on match events.

## 7. Security
JWT authentication for stateless, secure access.

HTTPS enforced on all API endpoints.

Passwords stored securely with salted hashing.

CORS configured to allow only authorized frontends.

## 8. Development & Deployment Plan
Follow detailed Project Roadmap milestones for iterative development.

Use Docker and Ansible to create reliable, repeatable deployment processes.

Implement CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI) for automated building, testing, and deploying.

Deploy initially to a staging environment before production release.

Monitor app health and logs in production for early problem detection.

## 9. Tools & Libraries
Backend: ASP.NET Core, SignalR, MongoDB.Driver

Frontend: React Native, Expo, Axios, @microsoft/signalr

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Authentication: JWT (OAuth optional)

DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions/GitLab CI, Ansible

Development: Visual Studio, VS Code, Postman

## 10. Notes
Designed for flexibility to support multiple content verticals (food, fitness, travel, entertainment, etc.)

Modular architecture to enable quick adaptation or expansion with new content types and external data sources

Focus on smooth user experience and real-time interactivity

Emphasis on automated, reliable deployment and operations
